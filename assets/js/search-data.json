The first is required for aperitiiif to work and the second and third are highly encouraged. | Add a row for each item you created in the last tutorial and fill in the id column. For the example batch in the last tutorial, this would look like the following: . | id | label | description | . | 001 | My first label | Description for my first item… | . | 002 | My second label | Description for my second item… | . | 003 | My third label | Description for my third item… | . | 004 | My fourth label | Description for my fourth item… | . | 005 | My fifth label | Description for my fifth item… | . If your item has multiple files, they will be automatically loaded as long as you followed the instructions in 2: Collect the batch images. The metadata in each row should refer to the entire item; Aperitiiif does not currently support asset-level metadata (e.g., labels for each page in a book item.) . | Next fill in the label and description fields for the items. | Lastly, if you have custom metadata that you would like to display in the final IIIF manifests, you can create new columns. To be shown, the header name needs to have the prefix meta. For example, to have the IIIF manifests to show “Place of Origin” information, you would add the following: . | id | label | description | meta.Place of Origin | . | 001 |   |   | Ogulin, Croatia | . | 002 |   |   | Borilovets, Vidin | . | 003 |   |   | Gomesende, Galicia | . | 004 |   |   | Chai Chumphon, Uttaradit | . | 005 |   |   | Bo Suphan, Suphan Buri | . Every single row must have a unique id that matches a batch item. For every other column (e.g., description), a blank field is OK; it just won’t show up in the manifest. For this reason, a blank is preferable to something like N/A, which will clutter the manifest. | When your spreadsheet is complete (it can always be updated later!) save it then export a copy to CSV format using UTF-8 encoding. | Move the exported CSV into the folder you created in the last tutorial (e.g., batch_workspace) and rename it records.csv | .
