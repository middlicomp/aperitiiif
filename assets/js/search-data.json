To be shown, the header name needs to have the prefix meta. For example, to have the IIIF manifests to show “Place of Origin” information, you would add the following: . | id | label | description | meta.Place of Origin | . | 001 |   |   | Ogulin, Croatia | . | 002 |   |   | Borilovets, Vidin | . | 003 |   |   | Gomesende, Galicia | . | 004 |   |   | Chai Chumphon, Uttaradit | . | 005 |   |   | Bo Suphan, Suphan Buri | . Every single row must have a unique id that matches a batch item. For every other column (e.g., description), a blank field is OK; it just won’t show up in the manifest. For this reason, a blank is preferable to something like N/A, which will clutter the manifest. | When your spreadsheet is complete (it can always be updated later!) save it then export a copy to CSV format. | Move the exported CSV into the folder you created in the last tutorial (e.g., batch_workspace) and rename it records.csv | .
